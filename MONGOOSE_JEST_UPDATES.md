# Mongoose/Jest Compatibility Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to ensure our testing environment follows Mongoose best practices when using Jest.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Updated Jest Configuration**:
   - Created a dedicated `jest-node.config.js` for server tests with `testEnvironment: 'node'`
   - Maintained the original config for Angular tests

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Added `SUPPRESS_JEST_WARNINGS=1` to all Jest test scripts
   - Installed `cross-env` for cross-platform environment variable support

3. **Database Connection Handling**:
   - Updated `setupDatabase()` to properly disconnect any existing connections
   - Added a check to verify connection state before disconnecting
   - Disabled Mongoose's buffer commands with `mongoose.set('bufferCommands', false)`

4. **Timer Protection**:
   - Added code to preserve original timer functions
   - Restored timer functions in beforeAll to prevent interference with Mongoose

5. **Browser vs Node Environment**:
   - Added conditional checks for browser objects in setup-jest.ts
   - Separated Angular and Node.js test configurations

6. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `test/README.md`
   - Documented Mongoose-specific Jest considerations

## References

The changes were based on recommendations from:

1. [Mongoose Official Documentation on Jest Testing](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/jest.html)
2. [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration)
3. [mongodb-memory-server Documentation](https://github.com/nodkz/mongodb-memory-server)

## Verified Tests

All server-side tests now run successfully with these changes. The updates allow:

- Proper isolation between tests
- Clean connection management
- Suppression of irrelevant warnings
- Consistent behavior across development and CI environments

## Future Considerations

1. Consider migrating to Mocha for server tests if Jest compatibility issues persist
2. Maintain separate test configurations for Angular and Node.js components
3. Be cautious when adding libraries that might interfere with Mongoose's timer usage
