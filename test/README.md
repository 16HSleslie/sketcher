# Testing Strategy Documentation

This document outlines the testing approach for the Book Bindery application, following best practices from Node.js, MongoDB, and modern testing frameworks.

## Testing Hierarchy

We use a 3-level testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests** (`/test/server/unit/`)
   - Test individual modules in isolation
   - Mock all external dependencies
   - Focus on data validation, business logic, and edge cases
   - Fast execution

2. **API Tests** (`/test/server/api/`)
   - Test public API endpoints
   - Verify request/response contracts
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Test error handling

3. **Integration Tests** (`/test/server/integration/`)
   - Test interactions between multiple components
   - Verify workflows and business processes
   - End-to-end testing of key user journeys

## Test Database

Tests use a dedicated in-memory MongoDB database (via `mongodb-memory-server`) to ensure:
- Tests are isolated from production data
- Each test suite starts with a clean database
- No need for external database setup
- Fast execution

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only API tests
npm run test:api

# Run tests with code coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Structure

Each test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:
1. **Arrange**: Set up test data and conditions
2. **Act**: Perform the action being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the results

## Helpers and Utilities

- `test/setup.js`: Database setup and teardown
- `test/jest.setup.js`: Global Jest configuration
- `test/server/helpers/`: Helper functions and test data

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other
2. **Speed**: Tests should run quickly
3. **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and update
4. **Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage of critical paths
5. **Clean setup/teardown**: Each test starts with a clean environment

## Conventions

- Test files should end with `.test.js`
- Test files should be organized by type (unit, api, integration)
- Each test case should test a single behavior
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
