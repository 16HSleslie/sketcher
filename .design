🌿 Cursor IDE Context Document: Lily's Bookbinding Website

🏡 Project Essence:

The website is for Lily, a bookbinder with a deeply rooted love for cottagecore, cabin-core aesthetics, and medieval fantasy (inspired by dragons, knights, and the fantasy world of Game of Thrones). The design should embody her personality—warm, rustic, whimsical, and artisanal—while prominently showcasing her handcrafted books.

🎨 Visual Style & Mood:

Visual Elements: Smartly blended colors, elegant imagery, and subtle decorative accents rather than heavy textures.

Color Palette: Earthy, muted tones—sage greens, soft creams, warm browns, vintage sepia, and gentle gold accents.

Typography: Elegant serif fonts (reminiscent of classic literature) combined with handwritten or script-style fonts for personal touches.

🐉 Fantasy & Whimsy:

Incorporate subtle fantasy motifs: small dragons curling around text frames or book illustrations, medieval-style initials, knightly emblems.

Visual storytelling elements such as hand-drawn illustrations or sketches referencing medieval folklore.

📚 Bookbinding Emphasis:

Detailed close-ups and images highlighting the artisanal process: stitching, binding, covers, and paper texture.

Visual galleries showcasing finished products with aesthetic staging (books near candles, on wooden tables, next to dried herbs and flowers).

🐴🐱 Personal & Organic Touches:

Illustrations or decorative motifs inspired by her animals—horses grazing, cats lounging—integrated seamlessly into the design.

Personalized touches, such as Lily's favorite quotes from fantasy literature or brief handwritten-style notes from Lily herself.

🖥️ UI & UX Principles:

Smooth, organic user interactions; subtle transitions resembling page-turning or gentle animation effects.

Easy navigation that feels natural and intuitive, mirroring the comfort and simplicity of cottage-core lifestyle.

Mobile-responsive design prioritizing visual harmony and readability.

🔥 Inspirational Elements:

Candlelit ambience, warm natural lighting effects in photographs and visuals.

Rustic cabin aesthetics: cozy interiors, vintage furniture, shelves overflowing with books, herbs drying from rafters.

Mystical yet subtle elements inspired by medieval fantasy worlds, integrated to enhance the overall magical feel without overpowering the artisanal charm.

✨ Final Note:

This site aims not only to showcase Lily’s bookbinding but also to create an inviting, immersive digital space that captures the magic, charm, and warmth of her unique cottagecore-meets-medieval-fantasy world.
